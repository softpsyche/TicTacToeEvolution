	Given I start a new game
	Given I setup the mock ILiteDatabase.FindByIndex method to return the following MoveResponses
		| Board     | Player | Response | Outcome |
		| ____X____ | O      | Eastern  | XWin    |
	Given I expect an exception to be thrown
	When I have the AI make the next random best move
