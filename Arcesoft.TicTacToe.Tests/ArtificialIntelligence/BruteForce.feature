Feature: BruteForce
	Verify that the brute force artificial intelligence works correctly

Background: 
	Given I have a container
	Given I have a tictactoe factory
	Given I have the artificial intelligence 'BruteForce'


Scenario: Brute force AI should find no moves if game is already over
	Given I start a new game with the following moves
		| Move     |
		| Northern |
		| Eastern  |
		| Center   |
		| Western  |
		| Southern |
	Given I expect an exception to be thrown
	When I have the AI find move results for the current game
	Then The move results should be empty

#This is a pretty slow test...Left here as an example on how this sort of 
#testing can create a tax on performance even though its still a test that does not cross any
#process boundaries.
#it is perhaps a bad test if we consider we have some other options to get similar
#coverage that might be faster.
#however, this also proves that moving first in tic tac toe is preferable...
